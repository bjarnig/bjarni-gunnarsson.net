              <p>Paths consists of five compositions forming a totality of 53 minutes. The music is derived from three multichannel pieces premiered at the Tectonics festival in Reykjavík (2014), the Ephémère series in The Hague (2014) and Présences électronique festival in Paris (2015). These have been further reduced, combined and rearranged resulting in the five compositions found on the album.</p>

            Safn 2006-2009 was released by <a href="http://lamadameaveclechien.com/"><strong>Lamadameaveclechien</strong></a> in January 2010. The album is a collection of pieces I composed from late 2006
            to early 2009. In September 2006 I left Iceland for Paris where I lived for a year. After living there I moved to Berlin where I stayed for two years until I went to Holland where I live now.
            The record "Safn 2006-2009" compiles pieces I composed during my time in France and Germany and that I found completed each other as a whole.<br><br>
            "...The seven compositions found on this CD share an organic and
            convolving character which develops in both a very continuous and
            dramatic way.
            The sound material varies from voices, violins and percussive sounds,
            treated in a such a way to give a big impression of a haunting tension
            and suspense. The intricate proceedings of the flow of sound, rich
            multi-layered textures and energetic percussive gestures gives the
            album an
            unheard quality which has to be experienced sonically to be fully
            understood. The CD comes in a wonderful organic grey handmade tissue."</p>

          </div>

          <p>Korabie contains six new pieces purely composed or created around improvisations during 2009-2001. The main focus is the exploration of the combination between voice and electronics. On Korabie a dense fabric of sound is brought to existence where voices and vocal manipulations meet drones and microsounds. The music seems to be coming from multiple sources. Dynamic forms emerge and spaces appear from the intimate relationship of the human voice and electronics.</p>
          <p>
            "it’s the crafting of subtle interactions that stand out on this body of work. At times almost silent and alien in construction, voices — both treated and untreated — subliminally reveal themselves as loosened strands forming a web above the uneven electrical landscape. A warm hum of analog synths bend and contort in the most serene patterns as if naturally expelled from the center of the cosmos. Eerie at times, Korabie also blends microscopic audio slivers through a maze of hiccuped vocal stretches. Often crumpled at the edges, these pulses of articulated eruptions ebb and flow delivering soundtrack inspired layers that will either pull you into its disjointed textural hub or deter you from entering altogether. Either way, Korabie is a sublime collision between organic and inorganic ingredients meant for 3am listening."

          </div>

          <p>Lost & Found" is Einóma's new EP, released on Shipwrec records (NL) in 2011 on 12" vinyl. .</p><p> The record features one long new track on the A-side as well as two older and previously unreleased pieces for the B-side. The main track, 'Bla' was conceived after editing real-time and live sessions made for gigs after the release of last years 'Tvenna' EP.The sound material 'Bla' was initially made from was quite old and the idea and title of the EP, 'Lost and found' came about, reworking of older ideas in a new setting. The A-side demonstretes the more dancefloor sides of Einóma while the B-side explores the more dark and dense regions Einóma have become more known for. </p>

          <p>"Freaky Techno and electronic beats by former Vertical Form contributors, Einóma. The Icelandic duo have been off the radar since 2009s 'Tvenna' EP, whose recording sessions provided the raw material for the tracks on 'Lost & Found'. Conceived through real-time editing and live sessions, 'Bla' pitches and twists through an intricate and organic 4/4 techno matrix, stretched between dense thickets of noise and sparse, hallucinatory drum patterns. Both 'BF' and 'LF' on the flip are more mutant, HipHop-tempo electronica, amorphous, sinister and slithering. Appears in hand silk-screened sleeves with unique download code redeemable from the label. Limited to 300 copies."<br>

          <p>Released on LMALC (BE) in 2010 on 12" vinyl and special edition 12" white vinyl. <br><br>

          After three years of silence and six years since the highly acclaimed "Milli Tonverka" LP, Reykjavik´s Einoma return with a highly beat-driven and epic two track EP for Lamadameaveclechien. Composing for the first time pieces based on live sets and improvisations, the EP shows a more organic nature of Einoma´s sound. Its complex sound flow still remains very rhythmic and almost dance floor like in it´s unfolding sound quality. Big emphasis on bass, icy textures, detailed sound design and an almost repetitive narrative is the main focus point of these two very original and dramatic pieces. The EP comes with a stunning artwork and a big poster from Sherrie Thai from Shaire productions who´s 'graphic alchemy' seems to fit the music perfectly on a fundamental level. <br><br>

          "Tvenna is highly original, engaging, and recommended for any fan of challenging music.﻿" <br>
          <strong>igloomag.com</strong><br><br>

          "Driven by a relentless beat and a metallic groove, Minióma is the most upbeat of the two, its highly mechanised rhythm set on a seemingly unstoppable path. While the pace slows down for a time half way through, to open up on a much more subtle atmospheric groove, it soon picks up again but becomes slightly less predictable, stumbles upon itself, picks up again before eventually losing momentum entirely. Stepóma initially seems harsher, more abrupt and concussed, more arid too, led by a post industrial metallic beat, but the more complex aspect of the track makes it even more subject to drastic rhythmic and atmospheric shifts than its predecessor." <br>

          <p>
          "Einóma's (Icelandic electronic duo Bjarni Thor Gunnarsson and Steindór Kristinsson) ice-cold, ethereal brand of IDM-funk gets a dramatic workout on Encam, the group's four-track follow-up to its 2003 Mille Tónverka album. Despite the passage of four years, the group's severe sound remains as intricate and obsessive as ever; though machine-generated, it's also rather tribal in character. The title cut's a brooding epic that pairs a vaguely hip-hop influenced lurch with choral shouts that echo across the snow-covered tundra; in his remix, kindred spirit and Spezial Material artist Traject (Gísli Þór Guðmundsson) intensifies the dark spirit of the original by deepening its choral dimension and plunging it even further into a nightmarish zone. The remaining cuts uphold the EP's brooding character with spectral turbulence (“Viðveran”) and an atmospheric evocation of an underground pool that's so still, stalactites' drips shatter the silence like gunshots (“Truflun”)." <br>

          "This is music created with the heart of high technology and the soul of a spirit world not usually seen with human eyes. The songs here create an emotional resonance that goes beyond just saying they make haunting music. Instead, they offer a fleeting glimpse of the other, the in-between. A presence that makes itself felt with every listen. Special things happen when the lights go dim. Welcome the darkness and let the magic begin. Highly Recommended." <br>
