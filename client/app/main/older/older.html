          <p>
          "Our sense of time is highly dependent on the mental categories of memory and attention. Without events being perceived and relationships in memory formed we can not really talk about experienced time. By memory and comparison we can create time and its categoriess: past, present, future. Of these three the present remains the most mysterious since it is there that events are experienced and categorized to referential memory locations. <br><br>  In ‘Boundary particulars’ Bjarni Gunnarsson and Cedric Dupire attempt to blur our sense of experienced time by emphasizing the moment and all it´s detail. The focus here is on the smallest offered in both sound and image, to engage the micro-events and bring forward new and emergent visual and auditory forms." <br><br>

              Our new  album with <a class="bgLink" href="http://mgbg.net">MGBG</a> <a class="bgLink" href="http://mgbg.bandcamp.com">Korabie</a> has been released! <br /><br />
              Korabie features six new pieces purely composed or created around improvisations during roughly the last two years. The main focus is the exploration of the combination between voice and electronics. On Korabie a dense fabric of sound is brought to existence where voices and vocal manipulations meet drones and microsounds. The music seems to be coming from multiple sources. Dynamic forms emerge and spaces appear from the intimate relationship of the human voice and electronics.
              <br /><br />
               "it’s the crafting of subtle interactions that stand out on this body of work. At times almost silent and alien in construction, voices — both treated and untreated — subliminally reveal themselves as loosened strands forming a web above the uneven electrical landscape. A warm hum of analog synths bend and contort in the most serene patterns as if naturally expelled from the center of the cosmos. Eerie at times, Korabie also blends microscopic audio slivers through a maze of hiccuped vocal stretches. Often crumpled at the edges, these pulses of articulated eruptions ebb and flow delivering soundtrack inspired layers that will either pull you into its disjointed textural hub or deter you from entering altogether. Either way, Korabie is a sublime collision between organic and inorganic ingredients meant for 3am listening."

            Presentation of L'imaginaire du parleur at Sonology concert, a 8 channel piece composed together with Marie Guilleray during our residency at GRM, Paris. <br /><br />
            "L'imaginaire du parleur" is inspired by Roland Barthes’s description of the grain of the voice in his essay "Le grain de la voix" (Ed. Seuil 1977). According to Barthes, "the grain of the voice is what is lost in transcription. It’s an exterior body, which, in situation of dialogue with an other body, both fragile, sends some messages intellectually empty, in order to catch the other and to maintain him in a state of partnership. Transcribed, the speech changed recipient and subject. The body, still there, stops to match with the person or more precisely with the personality. The imagination of the speaker changes space. It’s not anymore a request, a call, or a game of contacts; it’s about installing and representing an articulated discontinuation, in other words, an argumentation."

          "In the process of composing many different choices are usually made that in
          the end form a piece of music. After completing a piece a composer might
          reflect on its creation and think which of the choices he took had the most
          influence on the final outcome. This reflection might also take into
          consideration the relationships between the choices he took and the possible
          hierarchy they form, where some influence each other directly and others do
          not. In many cases an initial idea or concept can have a very strong
          impression on the final outcome of a piece of music and is something
          composers usually would talk about  in program notes like these. What about
          all the other choices a composer takes later in the process? Are they less
          important? Could they apply in other contexts? Could the order they are
          taken in be altered to drastically affect a piece? Could the choices maybe even
          be considered as material for a composition?
          <br><br>
          These relationships of choices inspired the creation of my piece 'Aukera' where the aim was to keep track of
          every step of the process in order to enable backtracking for all actions taken.
          A hierarchy of events was created that could be changed at every moment so
          the piece could remain completely dynamic and open until it was recorded.
          The idea was to put focus on the formal choices and how those choices could

          material was reduced even further to explore what remained important and
          what was essential for this piece composed around its own creation."

            'Grey Seeds' will be diffused at the third CASS concert in the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, 28.03 at 19:30. <br><br>

            "Shortly after returning from a long vacation in my native country Iceland last summer, I came across recordings that I had made two years earlier of trees and broken branches in a forrest in Germany. I felt that these trees somehow sounded lifeless and empty and they got me to think about the great contrast between the green and wooded landscapes of Holland or Germany and the rough and vast spaces in Iceland, where almost a third of the country is an official desert. I thought that the sounds of the german trees deserved a more interesting destiny and decided I would make them stronger, more energetic, more unique and more capable to operate in a ruthless surrounding.
            <br><br>
            This resulted in my piece 'Grey seeds' where the conflict between the far and the near, the empty and full, the lonely or the crowded has become the main topic. Initially inspired by contrasting elements in nature, I now realize that what for me appears to be an internal struggle of elements in this piece has started to mean something else, something more personal and inspiring than the green woods of Germany or the black deserts in Iceland ever ware to me."

          <p>
            With Marie Guilleray we will premiere a new piece 'Duality' next Tuesday at the Sonology discussion concert.<br /><br />
            " 'Duality' is based on the process of hypnosis and the theory of a
            hidden observer as discovered by Ernest Hilgard. In hypnosis, the
            hidden observer is the part of the self that is aware of things
            outside conscious awareness. The question of a divided consciousness
            inspired the unfolding of this piece where multiple controls in human
            thought and action operate at the same time. The piece fluctuates
            between states of order and disorder where a tension is created
            between the conscious and unconscious. The text was created from
            segment of Andre Breton's text voayge dans la duality."

          <p>
          "Lost&Found" is Einóma's new EP, out in February 2011 on Shipwrec records. The record features one long new track on the A-side as well as two older and previously unreleased pieces for the B-side. The main track, 'Bla' was conceived after editing real-time and live sessions made for gigs after the release of last years 'Tvenna' EP.The sound material 'Bla' was initially made from was quite old and the idea and title of the EP, 'Lost and found' came about, reworking of older ideas in a new setting. The A-side demonstretes the more dancefloor sides of Einóma while the B-side explores the more dark and dense regions Einóma have become more known for.
          <br><br>

          From <a class="bgLink" href="http://boomkat.com/vinyl/384688-einoma-lost-found-ep"><strong>Boomkat:</strong></a> 
          <br>
          "Freaky Techno and electronic beats by former Vertical Form contributors, Einóma. The Icelandic duo have been off the radar since 2009s 'Tvenna' EP, whose recording sessions provided the raw material for the tracks on 'Lost & Found'. Conceived through real-time editing and live sessions, 'Bla' pitches and twists through an intricate and organic 4/4 techno matrix, stretched between dense thickets of noise and sparse, hallucinatory drum patterns. Both 'BF' and 'LF' on the flip are more mutant, HipHop-tempo electronica, amorphous, sinister and slithering. Appears in hand silk-screened sleeves with unique download code redeemable from the label. Limited to 300 copies. Recommended to fans of Funckarma, Autechre, Made."
