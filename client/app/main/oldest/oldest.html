Einóma on Spezial Material<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.spezialmaterial.ch/"><img onload="this.style.opacity='1.0';" src="assets/images/SM028_Compilation_04_2047.jpg" alt="SM4"></a><br /><br />

"A new <a class="bgLink" href="http://www.spezialmaterial.ch/">Spezial Material</a> compilation will be released on the 01.02.2011. The fourth label compilation SM4 documents the expansion of the spectrum.
A double CD containing 22 projects presents do-it-yourself in the next generation."

<br /><br />

The compilation features a previously unreleased track by Einóma called LF. Einóma did a very nice Spezial Material tour with label owner Cio and artists Intricate and Traject around Europe in 2006.
The SM people seem to have been rather quiet the past years but this compilation seems interesting.

Two concerts this week, the first in the Wave Field Synthesis system in the Scheltema Complex in Leiden Thursday, my piece Fallacies with Miguel Negrão will be diffused. It«s the first of this years Sonology concerts with the WFS in Leiden.
<br /><br />On Saturday, Einóma will play live at Cramers in Den Haag. We will play bits from the current live set we have been evolving but also older bits and pieces and material from the new Lost&Found EP.

Safn review on the milk factory
    <p><img onload="this.style.opacity='1.0';" src="assets/images/milklogo.png" alt="Tvenna, Safn 2006-2009 review" width="620"><br /><br />  5/5 ".. an outstanding record from beginning to end."<br /><br /> "In just seven tracks of stark minimal abstract electronic compositions, spread over nearly fifty minutes, Gunnarsson creates an incredibly complex and haunting sonic universe with very few equals around. His soundscapes are often broken and twisted, fragmented into vibrant sub-sections,
    themselves articulated around tiny sonic particles and miniature themes. Each of these tracks work on so many levels that it is difficult to actually grasp what is really going on in one seating, yet the way Gunnarsson presents all this is so extremely attractive that it doesn't actually matter much."

    Angst in CASS<br>
    <p><img onload="this.style.opacity='1.0';" src="assets/images/angstCass.gif" alt="Bjarni Gunnarsson, CASS, Angst"><br /><br /> Playing at the CASS concert seried on monday at the Royal Conservatory in Den Haag. <br /><br />The piece will be a revised and longer (almost 12 minutes) version of 'Angst', a piece that I composed last winter.

    <br /><br />
    "Angst started as an experiment in composing with various microsound techniques. The piece quickly shifted direction when I
unexpectedly found the heater of my house producing similar pitches to those of the textures I had been generating for my
piece. <br /><br />I recorded the heater and then created a flow of sounds directed by the slow movements the heater produces when put
into motion. The sound material is a mixture of very short sounds, granular textures and transformations of the low pitch
drones produced by the heater. These sounds interact in various ways producing a very dense and introverted world which
fluctuates between states of order and disorder. The piece was premiered on the 19 of January 2010 at the third discussion
concert of the Institute of Sonology in Den Haag. I recently extended its final section."

  Z zondag
    <p><img onload="this.style.opacity='1.0';" src="assets/images/zondag.jpg" alt="Marie&Bjarni, Z zondag"><br /><br /> Playing sunday at Z-zondag, het land van X en Y, Villa Ockenburgh. The venue is fantastic, a small house far from the noisy city of Den Haag. Various artists will showcase their works and I am very happy
    to be playing with Marie Guilleray, performing a new piece that was specially written for the location.
    <br /><br />
    "Our piece "In between" is inspired by the way resonances can connect together, disturb each other and create new sonic and imaginary environments. The idea is of a pure tone that gives birth to other and more complex acoustic experiences and invites both the performer and listener to participate in this journey. "In between" is the path taken from and to very pure points and examines what happens in the more chaotic states between these two. This could be understood as a parallel world where the listener can witness how a simple sound can evoke images of places, explosions, sounds from nature or mirrors of a performer own sound. "In between" is composed for computer, voice and three gongs."

<p>WFS with Miguel Negrão in Berlin<br><br>
    <img onload="this.style.opacity='1.0';" src="assets/images/wfsberlin.jpg" alt="Fallacies, Bjarni Gunnarsson and Miguel Negrão"><br /><br /> Playing thursday night in Berlin, TU WaveField synthesis, 832 speakers a new 24 min piece composed with Miguel Negrão.
    <br /><br />
    "Fallacies is a collaboration piece between Bjarni Gunnarsson and Miguel Negrão. It concerns the real-time interaction and relationships between gradually evolving sine wave drones and dense, dynamic microsounds. The idea is of journey in an indeterminate direction: a global movement carried by an intense current of enfolding sound-masses that get disturbed and affected by streams of high-density subatomic events. Fallacies is a multichannel creation and is to be performed by the two performers in the Wave Field Synthesis system. The project is created around ideas developed after composing for the WFS system in Leiden."

    This concert is the first one I will play with Marie Guilleray, a very talented vocalist/improvisor/composer whom I have been working with for a few months now. The project explores the use of voice and electronics and for this occasion Marie also

    Windveine<br><br>
    <img onload="this.style.opacity='1.0';" src="assets/images/wfs-header-2.jpg" width="620" alt="Wave Field Synthesis, Bjarni Gunnarsson - WFS"><br /><br />A new piece 'Windveine' premiered.<br /><br />
    On the 11th of May there will be a premiere of a new piece of mine called "Windveine" composed especially for the Wave Field Synthesis
    system in Leiden. I have been working in with the system in Leiden these past weeks, experimenting with various stretegies of sptializing my sound material for this new piece
    and I am very excited about the result. When working directly with sounds surrounding you by 192 speakers I feel I have been guided towards something else, something new for me.
    I hope to continue working with the WFS technology.
    <br /><br />
    "In 1988 professor Berkhout (Technical University of Delft) invented the principle of Wave Field Synthesis (WFS).<br /><br />
    Wave Field Synthesis is based on the Huygens' principle. In his TraitŽ de la lumire Christiaan Huygens stated that a wavefront can be reconstructed from a continuous distribution of secondary sources on the wave front.<br /><br />
    Lord Rayleigh advanced this theory by demonstrating that one can achieve the same result using secondary sources in a planer configuration.<br /><br />
    Professor Berkhout subsequently conceived the idea that it is possible to reconstruct a virtual source.<br /><br />
    An advantage of WFS is that the "sweet spot", typical in stereo reproduction, is enlarged to a "sweet area". This is because the reproduction is not based on psychoacoustical principles but on a physical reproduction of the sound field.<br /><br />
    A "sweet spot" means that there is only one listening position where the spatial effect is rendered correctly. A "sweet area" means that there is a listening area and as a result many listeners can perceive the spatial rendering correctly at the same time.<br /><br />
    A consequence of the physical reproduction of the sound field is that Doppler effects (i.e. sound of a passing siren) are rendered in a natural way.<br /><br />
    In WFS sounds can be placed in front of the speakers. This is called a "focused source"."<br /><br />

    I will be diffusing a new piece of mine called Angst. The piece was created from various experiments with microsounds combined with recordings made of the heater in my house
    that appears to have some sort of misterious behavior in the wintertime. There will be 24 different speakers and I will be playing in real-time with diffusing the piece in the
    big space of Shoenberg Hall at the Royal Conservatory in Den Haag.
